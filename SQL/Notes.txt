------------Partitions-------------------

Partitions split a large table into smaller table splits by the 
partition key/column eg date. This allows for more efficient storage
and faster querying when filtering by partition e.g all data since date X

Good thing about partitions is that they dont affect the queryer (the partitions 
are taken care of by the database itself)
