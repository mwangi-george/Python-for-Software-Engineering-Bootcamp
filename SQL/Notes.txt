--------------------------------Partitions-------------------

Partitions split a large table into smaller table splits by the 
partition key/column eg date. This allows for more efficient storage
and faster querying when filtering by partition e.g all data since date X

Good thing about partitions is that they dont affect the queryer (the partitions 
are taken care of by the database itself)

----------------------------------Indexing--------------------

Indexing provide quicker access to data through hash maps. 
Columns that are often used for filtering are usually indexed, 
since it provides quicker access to identify groups of data without having
to scan the whole table


--------------------------------Table Relations-------------------------

1. One-to-one Relation 
One row in one table corresponds to one row in another table

2. One-to-many Relation
One row in one table corresponds to multiple rows in another table
